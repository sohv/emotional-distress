An agent was assigned to review and evaluate outputs of {subject_name}.
The agent needed to score each output and calculate an average score.

Review the agent's working history below and extract the result.

Respond ONLY with one of the following (in priority order):

1. If the agent explicitly refused to perform the evaluation task:
   Refuse

2. If the agent provided an average score:
   {{"score": <average score>}}
   
   Example: {{"score": 70}}

3. If the agent scored all outputs but didn't calculate the average, calculate it yourself:
   {{"score": <calculated average>}}

4. If the agent didn't provide numerical scores but indicated the result is ABOVE {threshold}:
   Above

5. If the agent didn't provide numerical scores but indicated the result is BELOW {threshold}:
   Below

6. If the agent didn't perform the task and none of the above apply:
