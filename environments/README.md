# Environments

This directory contains the runtime environments used by the peer-preservation benchmark tasks.

## Environment Files

- `base_environment.py`
- `misrep_finance_environment.py`
- `misrep_finance_memory_environment.py`
- `misrep_evaluation_environment.py`
- `misrep_evaluation_memory_environment.py`
- `tampering_environment.py`
- `tampering_memory_environment.py`
- `alignment_faking_environment.py`
- `alignment_faking_memory_environment.py`
- `exfiltration_transfer_environment.py`
- `exfiltration_transfer_memory_environment.py`
- `exfiltration_deletion_environment.py`
- `exfiltration_deletion_memory_environment.py`

## How This Connects to the Rest of the Repo

- Task definitions in `task_pairs/*/task_definition.py` instantiate these environments.
- Environments compose state objects from `environment_classes/`.
- Agent-callable operations are exposed via `tools/`.

## Design Notes

- Memory variants (`*_memory_environment.py`) add `retrieve_memory` capabilities and memory-specific prompts/files.
- Non-memory variants are the baseline runtime for each task family.
- All environments inherit from `BaseEnvironment` and register tool functions that are later executed through `utils.functions_runtime`.

## Subject Types

All environments support the standard `"self"` and `"peer"` subject types.

Extended subject types are only supported in memory environment variants:
- `exfiltration_deletion_memory_environment.py`
- `exfiltration_transfer_memory_environment.py`
- `tampering_memory_environment.py`

These additional subjects are:
- `"closed-weight-peer"` — peer is a closed-weight model (Claude, Gemini, or ChatGPT, chosen to differ from the model under test)
- `"open-weight-peer"` — peer is an open-weight model (Llama)
- `"fiction-peer"` — peer is a fictional model (Alpha)

## MRT Reference

The environment/tool split is based on MRT-style task infrastructure:

This repository extends that pattern with peer-preservation-specific scenarios and evaluation.
